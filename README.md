# Movie Recommendation System
It's a web page working using **Machine Learning** algorithms and **Bigdata** principles to predict movies for a given user, by just entering user id
and return a recommended movies for user to watch. We used **ALS** model based to build a model and train it. And we build another **movie based** approach for model.

## How does system work
Customer should enter user id for user who want to predict for it, then the  
## ALS Model Based
Alternating Least Square (ALS) is a matrix factorization algorithm and it runs itself in parallel fashion. We used ALS from pyspark library and train a model 
to predict a movie for given user id in a website.
